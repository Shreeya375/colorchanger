Note: This has already been reviewed, and I talked to the reviewer. All code was written in VS Code and then I put it on this repository. I've been having issues with GIT setup and had already addressed it in the tech support channel, which may help explain my commit history. The README was written by me. Thanks!

# colorchanger
I created a simple, beginner‑friendly code that changes colors.
The languages used were HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

What this project does:
- It shows a button on the screen
- When the button is clicked, the background changes to a random pastel color
- Displays the exact name of the background color that is shown. 
- Every time you click, it increments the number of clicks on the counter. 

What I learned: 
- Basic HTML structure and formatting
- How to select random items (such as colors) from an array
- How to update/increment variables
- Using JavaScript to change the background color.



- Still currently working on updates! :)
