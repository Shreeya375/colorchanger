# colorchanger
I created a simple, beginner‑friendly code that changes colors.
The languages used were HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

⭐ What this project does:
- It shows a button on the screen
- When the button is clicked, the background changes to a random pastel color
- Displays the color of the background and says the exact name. 
- Everything is inside one HTML file to make it easier to view.

⭐ What I learned: 
- Basic HTML structure and formatting
- How to select random items (such as colors) from an array
- Using Java Script to change the background color.

- Still currently working on updates! :)
